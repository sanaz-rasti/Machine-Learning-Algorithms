# Description
This folder contains two supervised Machine Learning approaches of Classification and Regression. 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Classification:
The classification file includes four different algorithms of:

1. Support Vector Machine 
Supervised max-margined classifier are supervised max-margin models.

2. K-Nearest Neighbour
KNN is a supervised non-parametric learning classifier. It uses proximity to make classification or predicting the groups of data points. 

3. Random Forest Classifier 
Consider several decision tree classifiers implemented on sub-samples of dataset. 

4. Logistic Regression 
Model the probability of discrete outcome given an input variable. 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Regression: 
Regression is a statistical method that attempts to predict or explain the variation in one variable based on another variable. The Regression file includes five different regression algorithms as described below:

1. Linear Regression
Let a simple regression equation as Y = mX + b, where Y is the response (dependant) and X is the predictor variable (independant). ÙŽUsing the linear regression from Scikit Learn library.

2. Decision Tree Regressor 
It is a supervised learning algorithm, used for continous and categorical output variables. 
The branches/edges represent the result of the nodes and the nodes have either: 
- Conditions
- Result

3. Support Vector Regressor
Find the decision boundaries and consider the points that are within the decision boundry line.

4. Losso Regression
The L1-regularization is a form of regularization for linear regression models, regularization is a statistical method to reduce errors caused by overfitting on training data. 

5. Random Forest Regressor
Is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree regressors and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy.
